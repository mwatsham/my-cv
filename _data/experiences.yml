        - Implemented a Python based Concourse CI resource type to enable integration of pipelines with AWS SQS queues which enabled a more dynamic and parameterised approach to triggering pipelines. Shared with the organisation SRE community, helped to reduce pipeline duplication, saving the organisation unnecessary AWS resource consumption.
        - Created an AWS SAM/Terraform development environment, utilising AWS SAM features to develop Lambda code locally whilst deploying AWS services using Terraform Concourse CI pipeline. Lambda developers were able unit test their code locally saving development time and improving deployment success rate.
        - Simplified the management of Terraform state by creating a pipeline to deliver AWS hosted state backend. This reduced the overhead for DevOps engineers to implement secure and resilient remote Terraform state backends, centralising state file management.
