  - title: VMWare NSX-T CI/CD Pipeline
    time: June - Sept 2022
    #link: ""
    tagline: "Designed and developed a Terraform based VMWare NSX-T configuration delivered via GitLab CI/CD. This required the adaptation of GitLab Runner Docker container images deployed to on-prem Rancher Kubernetes clusters to accommodate a more secure off-line environment. This benefitted business by reducing the required training overhead for NSX-T DFW delivery/configuration whilst satisfying the Security auditing requirement for distributed firewall changes. "
  - title: Puppet server build automation
    time: Sept 2013 - Mar 2014
    #link: ""
    tagline: "Transformed the process for the physical build Unix hosts by developing an Infrastructure-as-Code process using SpaceWalk, Cobbler, and Puppet. Server builds that could take days were brought down to minutes/hours. The consistency of the IaC approach also resulted in a reduction in incidents/call-outs plus a reduced resolution time due to consistent host configuration."
