  - title: Self-service compute deployment portal
    time: Dec 2022 - Present
    tagline: "Engaged in a pivotal project to deliver stakeholder aspirations of DevOps transformation. Simplifying the deployment process for private (VMWare) and public (AWS) cloud compute infrastructures via an intuitive self-service portal. Following an Agile methodology utilizing Jira, technically led the project opting to deliver a fully codified and automated process. Employing GitHub hosted repositories, Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), AWS managed services such as DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and SQS, driven through Concourse CI pipelines, created a repeatable and reliable integration and deployment process. <br>The solution successfully delivered standardized defaults and robust security measures to platform clients, guaranteeing a consistent and compliant computing environment. Reducing delivery time to minutes whilst also improving the security and compliance audit scores for delivered systems. This allowed clients to focus on their unique value propositions, confident in the stability of the provided compute platforms."
  - title: AWS hosted remote Terraform state backend
    time: Nov 2022
    link: "https://github.com/mwatsham/concourse-aws-terraform-backend"
    tagline: "Simplified the management of Terraform state backends by creating common shared service hosted in AWS. Defined a Terraform Concourse CI pipeline to automate the deployment and management of AWS S3 buckets, KMS keys, and DynamoDB tables to implement a secure and resilient remote Terraform state backend. Offered as a service this reduced the overhead for developers setting up remote Terraform state backends whilst improving the accessibility of state files, empowering greater developer collaboration."
  - title: VMWare NSX-T CI/CD Pipeline
    time: June - Sept 2022
    #link: ""
    tagline: "Designed and developed a Terraform based VMWare NSX-T configuration delivered via GitLab CI/CD. This required the adaptation of GitLab Runner Docker container images deployed to on-prem Rancher Kubernetes clusters to accommodate a more secure off-line environment. This benefitted business by reducing the required training overhead for NSX-T DFW delivery/configuration whilst satisfying the Security auditing requirement for distributed firewall changes. "
  - title: Puppet server build automation
    time: Sept 2013 - Mar 2014
    #link: ""
    tagline: "Transformed the process for the physical build Unix hosts by developing an Infrastructure-as-Code process using SpaceWalk, Cobbler, and Puppet. Server builds that could take days were brought down to minutes/hours. The consistency of the IaC approach also resulted in a reduction in incidents/call-outs plus a reduced resolution time due to consistent host configuration."
